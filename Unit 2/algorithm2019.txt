Design an algorithm stackequal, which checks whether the given two stacks
contain equal number of elements. If true, It checks whether the two stacks
contain elements in same order. Temporary stacks can be used and original
stack has to be undisturbed after operations.


1. Take the inputs for the top2
2. Have a function to get to total number of elements and checks
3.
